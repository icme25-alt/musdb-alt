Float like a butterfly sting like a bee
I float like a butterfly sting like a bee
Float like a butterfly sting like a bee
I float like a butterfly sting like a bee 

They tryna to knock me out
My back's against the ropes and I ain't losing hope
No not going down for the count
You can give me all you've got but I ain't gonna stop at all
You can throw your hooks your jabs it will take more than that to knock me off my hustle
I ain't giving up this belt so easy
You'll be giving up before you see me knocked out 

Always been quick give off the pump
Light a fire proceed to get my skunk on
Niggas be quick to hate because they need a dick to jump on
I'm in my zone banging molly all alone
While bitches see me with ash trying to get me out my home and I
Got a problem cause lately I try to overspend
To block out all the bullshit I put no focus in
Call bobby because philly's spitting that dope again
I got my back against the rope trying to rope them in
Like oh my I'm the coldest in charge, it's easy for them to hate when you be going this hard a
It's funny I tell them all you can meet me in hell itching
And get you on the phone and stop talking like  Mel Gibson, knock
Knock me out I think that's rare in my sport
You'se a gangster that's just trying to whip his hair back and forth,
I think it's time for you to pick again
Tryna hit you with that knockout glow, phoney nick name 

They tryna to knock me out
My back's against the ropes and I ain't losing hope, no
Not going down for the count
You can give me all you've got but I ain't gonna stop at all
You can throw your hooks your jabs it will take more than that to knock me off my hustle
I ain't giving up this belt so easy
You'll be giving up before you see me knocked out 

Ok I guess it's crunch time
The way I eat this bitch you probably think it's lunch time
Soon as I spit I bet you wonder why he's unsigned
The whole of the rap scene see how I throw these punchlines
But while you biting like tyson I'm still holding the crown
Plus I'm raping the game that's why I'm still holding it down
And you can't hold me back like your arm's gone
Getting on the track like I'm Armstrong
Up with this new shit so I can keep my fans up
That's why I hold the belt like I'm tryna keep my pants up
Hands up never drop your gun when I'm around
I'm the champ you a rookie and won't even last a round
See me knocking down this game with the punches and these hooks, bruh
Tekken-like I hit you with some punches and some hooks yeah 

You know I never quit, never been a  towel thrower
So you can stop the Russian like Rocky Balboa 

They tryna to knock me out
My back's against the ropes and I ain't losing hope no
Not going down for the count
You can give me all you've got but I ain't gonna stop at all
You can throw your hooks your jabs it will take more than that to knock me off my hustle
I ain't giving up this belt so easy
You'll be giving up before you see me knocked out 

One two one two ain't no telling what I'll do
When you step right up to me remember I don't like to loose
Hear me fear me ain't no standing toe to toe
The outcome's looking grim for you I sure hope that you know
Know you see I came from nothing watch me turn to something
Can't you feel the heat like the rain wasn't enough, enough
The stakes are high for me, there ain't no stopping me
Watch me float like a butterfly and sting like a bee 

They tryna  knock me out
My back's against the ropes and I ain't losing hope, no (My back's against the ropes)
Not going down for the count (No, no, no no)
You can give me all you've got but I ain't gonna stop at all
You can throw your hooks it jabs it will take more than that to knock me off my hustle (To knock me off my hustle)
I ain't giving up this belt so easy (You'll be giving up)
Before you see me knocked out (Knocked out)
