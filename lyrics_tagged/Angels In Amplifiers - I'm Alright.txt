I know the season's ripe for change, it's changing all around
I know the reasons you've arranged, they're tearing me down
Where is the peacefulness of mind?
Where will my heart come back to life? 

I'm alright
As I pick up the pieces that I've left of me
I'm alright
Being away from you
And I'll be fine
Cleaning up the corner
Putting back in order
But know I will always have this too
A little piece of you 

How could we let this slip away?
Slipping through my hands
How can the darkness blind the day?
Bring back the light
Where is the pleasure in the pain?
Where is my shelter in the rain? 

Well I'm alright
As I pick up the pieces that I've left of me
I'm alright
Being away from you
And I'll be fine
Cleaning out the corner
Put it back in order
But know I will always have this too
A little piece of you 

Help me dry all my tears and
Help me allay all my fears and
Help me I think I am fallin'
Does anybody hear me callin'?
Help me dry all my tears
Help me allay all my fears and
Help me I think I am fallin'
Does anybody hear me callin'? 

I'm alright
As I pick up the pieces that I've left of me
I'm alright
Being away from you
And I'll be fine
Cleaning up the corner
Put it back in order
I know I will always have this too, oh yeah 

I'm alright
As I pick up the pieces that I've left of me
I'm alright
Being away from you, and
I'll be fine
Cleaning up the corner
Putting back in order
But know I will always have this too
A little piece of you
