Took you out again on friday (Yeah)
Though In felt you didn't wanna ( <nl> uh-huh  <nl> )
Must have rubbed you up the wrong way ( <nl> woah-oh </nl> )
And it's something that's a matter of fact but I break the bank for you
So when my material girl's grumpy (Yeah)
I'll buy her bling with my last dollar ( <nl> mm-hmm </nl> ) 

(Now or never) tripping on this sheen off of you
(Now or never) picturing this dream coming true
(Now or never) pulling at the seams cause it seems to me that you and me now could be nothing but a stitch up baby 

Turn around
Make a sound
Understand just what this means to me
Turn around
Hit the ground
Understand this ain't the way it's supposed to be 

So I followed you on Sunday
Though I wasn't sure I ought to ( <nl> uh-huh </nl> )
Saw you two kissing on the causeway ( <nl> woah </nl> )
Wanted to push you in the water (Yeah) 

(Now or never) tripping on this sheen off of you
(Now or never) picturing this dream coming true
(Now or never) pulling at the seams cause it seems to me that you and me now could be nothing but a stitch up baby 

Turn around
Make a sound
Understand just what this means to me
Turn around
Hit the ground
Understand this ain't the way it's supposed to be 

Tripping on this sheen off of you
Picturing this dream coming true
Pulling at the seams cause it seems to me that you and me now could be nothing but a stitch up
(Now or never) Weak enough to through this away
(Now or never) Brave enough to say that it's now or never
Pulling at the seams cause it seems to me that you and me now could be nothing but a stitch up baby 

Turn around
Make a sound
Understand just what this means to me
Turn around
Hit the ground
Understand this ain't the way it's supposed to be, yeah 

Stitch up, stitch up, <nl> woah, </nl> stich up
Stitch up, stitch up, <nl> woah, </nl> stitch up
Stitch up
