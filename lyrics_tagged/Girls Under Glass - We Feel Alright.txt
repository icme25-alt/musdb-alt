And you watch me now
And your eyes do shine so bright by your emotion  

When you hold me now
I feel your heartbeat filled with devotion 

You're standing by my side
Together we enjoy the night
I will follow you
Into the shining light
You're standing by my side
Hand in hand we watch the light
When we feel alright
Alright 

When you hold my hand
I do not feel any fear while you disappear 

And you start to sing
Feel the energy
I am not afraid of anything
Of anything 

You're standing by my side
Together we enjoy the night
I will follow you
Into the shining light
You're standing by my side
Hand in hand we watch the light
And we feel alright
Alright
Alright 

You're standing by my side
Hand in hand we watch the light
And we feel alright alright
Alright
Alright
We feel alright
