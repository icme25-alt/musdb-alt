Unwinding us like string cut away the rot
Weeding out the thorns unraveling the knot
Let me unfold this map trace my finger down the path
Try to find my way back to where you are 

And your fears may never come
These years have come undone
Your fears may never come
And these years have come undone 

Broken man will I have to be
Always on my knees
To make you feel tall give you room to breathe
Will I never have just a sip of your love
In case I waste it in case I spill it on the floor 

And your fears may never come
These years have come undone
Your fears may never come
And these years have come undone 

Broken man I won't ask you to give
It's too much for you to pay
From empty hands 

And your fears may never come
These years have come undone
Your fears may never come
And these years have come undone 

And your fears may never come
These years have come undone
Your fears may never come
And these years have come undone
Broken man
