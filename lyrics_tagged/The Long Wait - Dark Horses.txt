Pleased to meet dan collins
Old blind drunk and falling he's falling in the street
Just tryna' find his feet
And here comes wife Eudora
She can't take much more but she still follows him around
And helps him to the ground
Two opposites together and they're both alone
Nothing gives true love a test like losing all you own
Come tears of loneliness and here come the rain 

You can hear him saying
Woman you can put that righteous mess on hold
Cause I can stand up on my own
And you can hear her pleading
Well Dan now I was only trying to help
So you can go to hell
You put love and a bag of dope in a grocery cart 

In any universe she'd still have given him her heart
They were always meant to be and that's the truth
And I guess it all depends on where you're coming from
And I guess it all depends on where you've been
I guess it all depends on where you're headed to
When a right turns wrong again
When a right turns wrong again
<nl> Oh-oh, oh-oh </nl> 

So where are you headed to, and can I come with you
You're such a pretty sight, sore eyes light of my life
In all his silliness she still remembers this
A long damn time ago when there were still dark horses out along the open road 

Grocery cart they push out
Broadway up to craycroft he's yelling at the cars
Under arizona stars
You put love and a bag of clothes in a grocery cart 

In any universe he'd still have given her his heart
They were always meant to be and that's the truth
I guess it all depends on where you're coming from
And I guess it all depends on where you've been
I guess it all depends on where you're headed to
When a right turns wrong again
When a right turns wrong again
<nl> Oh-oh, oh-oh </nl>
<nl> Oh-oh, oh-oh </nl>
<nl> Oh-oh </nl>
