Why oh why won't someone tell me
God only knows what I should do
Now watch the world is moving forward
But I am stuck, I can't push through 

I'm just catching up with yesterday
By tomorrow I'll be ready for today
And I'm just catching up with yesterday
And I don't know what to do, no 

A fragile girl, a broken woman
These walls have closed in all around
And I'm trapped inside this hazy prism
And my heart is nowhere to be found 

The clouds above about to thunder
In this stormy atmosphere
But by now I thought I'd be there
But the destination's what I fear 

I'm just catching up with yesterday
By tomorrow I'll be ready for today
So I'm just catching up with yesterday
And I don't know what to do, no 

Oh I can't shake this feeling
It steals contentment in my mind
And I keep looking for the answers
Oh that I, that I just can't seem to find 

And I'm just catching up with yesterday
But by tomorrow I'll be ready for today
Said I'm just catching up with yesterday
And I don't know what to do, no 

Oh I can't shake this feeling
Steals contentment in my mind
And I keep looking for the answers
Oh that I, that I just can't seem to find
