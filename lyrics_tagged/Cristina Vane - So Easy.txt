You know you're not at all to blame
I was the one that played your game
Cause it was so easy to make me believe you're worth my time
Don't call me babe cause I'm gone
You can make right what you did wrong
And if it's that easy just get up and leave the way you do 

And all this time
Wasted on you
I'll start anew
It blows my mind
To think I do
Those things for you
But this time
It's easy to leave when it's you that I leave behind 

There's really not that much to say
I'm just glad to be out on my way
Cause you were consuming me like I couldn't do better than you
I'm gonna watch you disappear
The blur that I once felt is so clear
Cause it's just that easy to get up and leave because it's you 

And all this time
Wasted on you
I'll start anew
It blows my mind
To think I do
Those things for you
But this time 

So I kept hoping you'd open your arms
The truth is you're nothing you only caused harm
And it's your fault 

And all this time
Wasted on you
I'll start anew
It blows my mind to think I do
To think I do
Those things for you
But this time
It's easy to leave 

And all this time
Wasted on you
I'll start anew
It blows my mind
To think I do those things for you but this
Those things for you
But this time it's easy to leave
It's easy to leave
