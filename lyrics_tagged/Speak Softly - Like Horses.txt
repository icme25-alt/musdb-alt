Opened my eyes this morning
I saw three white horses
Pass my window
I want to run
I want to ride
And I want to fly
With those horses 

I rode away from the city
And the horses led me to a valley
I want to glide
I want to fly
I want to soar
Through the sky 

I don't wanna say goodbye
Close my eyes and let it go
I don't wanna say goodbye
Close my eyes and let it go 

Lay down my head in the valley
And the sky closed over
Like curtains
I want to sleep
I want to dream
I want my dreams
To fly like horses 

I don't wanna say good bye
Close my eyes and let it go
I don't wanna say goodbye
Close my eyes and let it go 

With all of my desires and all I know
Surrendered
I will say goodbye
With all of my desires and all I know
Surrendered
I will say goodbye
I don't wanna say goodbye
Close my eyes and let it go 

I don't wanna say goodbye (With all of my desires and all I know)
Close my eyes and let it go (Surrendered I will say goodbye)
I don't wanna say goodbye (With all of my desires and all I know)
Close my eyes and let it go (Surrendered I will say goodbye)
