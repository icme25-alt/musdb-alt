I was hanging out
With some friends of mine
Down in Hollywood
Just wasting time
I knew right then
Nobody could get me down
Cause as I take myself
Out on the town
We're gonna have a good time 

I didn't think it could get much  better then this
And then Charlie said
I know a place
And so I went inside
That's when I saw her face
And then I knew I was gonna have a good time
Yeah, we're gonna have a good time
We're gonna have a good time, yeah 

Who playing now? 

She was the finest thing
That I ever did see
I walked over to her
Just begging her please
You wanna know what she said, she said
You're gonna have a good time
And she said you're gonna have a good time
And then she said something so fine, yeah 

We're gonna have a good time, yeah
We're gonna have a good time, yeah
We're gonna have a good time, yeah
