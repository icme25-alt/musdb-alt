She's the object of my fascination
Back to school, socks in the corner after last night's pull
Sure beats sums and multiplication
Life begins, she's forty-something and I'm all in
For the time of my life
She's cool as ice, she'd more than make a man of me
There's only one thing on my mind
That she'll be mine 

She's the object of my fascination
And that's what's real to me
A red hot chick by classification
But she's too blind to see in my car, she'd look just like a movie star
She's ten out of ten, a schoolboy fascination 

(A schoolboy fascination) School bell rings, I got detention but I 've done no wrong
I'm in love in my mind
A beauty queen, she looks like the girls in the magazines
I'm in love with her smile
She's heaven sent, but I know she's not that innocent
There's no better waste of time
I wish she was mine 

She's the object of my fascination and that's what's real to me
A red hot chick by classification, but she's too blind to see
In my car, she'd look just like a movie star
She's ten out of ten, a schoolboy fascination
Schoolboy fascination (Schoolboy fascination) 

She's cool as ice she'd more than make a man of me (Cool, cool as ice)
There's only one thing on my mind
That she'll be mine 

She's the object of my fascination, and that's what's real to me
A red hot chick by classification, but she's too blind to see
In my car she'd look just like a movie star
She's ten out of ten, a schoolboy fascination 

She's the object of my fascination, and that's what's real to me
A red hot chick by classification, but she's too blind to see
In my car she'd look just like a movie star
She's ten out of ten a schoolboy fascination
