We kick it dirty
There's party over here (Party over there)
I got some news in the mail today
Real aces in the game heard my name and couldn't pronounce it
So I'ma sit tight and stop rapping
Get a suit and a tie or they'll get me a muzzle
I sound so pissed, it got 'em puzzled
Why I'd be so serious and talk about issues it's too ambitious, they don't wanna hear it son (Son)
Frat boys and rich kids just wanna have fun and a shot at some bitches, nobody flinches
I roll up the boulder drop it on the spiritual sons of Travolta, regardless ever since they heard this I keep it heartless
Ah my name is elvis, I thrust my pelvis first I gotta dealt with the audience in memphis
And from the prom kids to the housewives in their kitchens
They're gonna love it if I sing with bitches so 

Sing with me my bitch (My bitch, my bitch)
Sing with me my bitch (My bitch, my bitch)
Sing with me my bitch (My bitch, my bitch)
Sing with me (My bitch my) 

<nl> (Woop, woop) </nl> I got some news in the mail today
I got nominated most talented from over the Atlantic
So they're gonna fly me over to New York City but there were talks of me playing in LA, I've never been there it's a shame
I gotta meet Doctor Dre, star in a little movie with Halle Berry
And my funny accent for relaxing piece of entertainment
They love it in the clubs since it came in, all this though I never was into the gaming
I was crowned king of double meaning cranky and with a stubble
My brain steaming, my name's not steven you can call me sensei ponte al frente te toca la suerte (Lights on the gente)
And then pitch black I switch back to a faded bitch slap 

Sing with me my bitch (My bitch my bitch)
Sing with me my bitch (My bitch my bitch)
Sing with me my bitch (My bitch my bitch my bitch my bitch)
Sing with me my bitch (My bitch, my) 

<nl> (Woop, woop) </nl> I got some news in the mail today
They say I gotta sound like I ain't saying his name he never said my name and I don't mind mate
I'm equally as sick but just more inhibited wasn't born in the land of the brave
With the blood  stains and cupcakes and third dates when you get to third base, <nl> um </nl>
I mean fornicate and demonstrate your textbook sex look, oh yeah
You can fuck but you can't say it, you gotta suck to get to be famous
And thank god and my penis, I got peanuts for all tracks masterpieces and no subpoenas
By the mail just a quick reminder, my shit ain't leaving the basement
I tried to keep away from the ditches but they said I gotta sing with bitches so  

Sing with me my bitch (My bitch my bitch)
Sing with me my bitch (My bitch my bitch)
Sing with me my bitch (My bitch my bitch)
Sing with me my bitch (My bitch my) 

<nl> (Woop, woop) </nl> and something's burning in the toaster, serving cat food in a glass on a coaster
Tipping Michael Jackson with a Barbie, now this is the story of how I wrecks the party
Thanks to the jury for the award I never would hope for more, thanks Ron for the cigar all those years of hard work for the people
It was worth all the trouble, the one dollar and the open bar and what with having my socks balled
Now I'm top dog all up in your rock bottom, the big pond crush it in my palms with the very important fishes and all the fly bitches
They told me the business was sedated, they don't use words that are complicated
I got a deal to keep  their heads banging you know the drill sing it sing it 

Sing with me my bitch (My bitch my bitch)
Sing with me my bitch (My bitch my bitch)
Sing with me my bitch (My bitch my bitch)
Sing with me my bitch (My bitch my) 

<nl> (Woop, woop) </nl> side effects y'all instigate terror in the land of the laymen, from k-pax to cayman (My bitch, my bitch)
Serving caviar to cavemen (My bitch, my bitch)
Sing with me my bitch (My bitch, my bitch)
Don't stop don't back down, till the fox gone or there's a blackout 

<nl> (Woop, woop) </nl>  sing with me my bitch (My bitch)
