Move in all directions
Don't try to stay still
Separate by silence
Made cold by the chill 

We should be connected
We should be brand new
We should have the courage to say that I want you
We shouldn't be lonely we
We shouldn't have doubt
We shouldn't be the ones to say that I want out, oh no 

I want to try to keep in touch
I'll write a letter
Or maybe I'll come and I'll see you
Would that be better 

We should be connected
We should be brand new
We should have the courage to say that I want you
We shouldn't be lonely
We shouldn't have doubt
We shouldn't be the ones to say that I want out
And if you tell me that you're keeping secrets I'd understand
But I can help you if you want me to do
And if you wanna see the world but you're alone just come and get me
Because I want to see the world too
<nl> Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh </nl> 

We should be connected
We should be brand new
We should have the courage to say that I want you
We shouldn't be lonely
We shouldn't have doubt
We shouldn't be the ones to say that I want out, oh no
Oh no
