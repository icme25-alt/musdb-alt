Burning in the early morning heat
Determined to stay on my feet
It's hard to be a tree in the desert
Expediency makes sense if you let it
Reasoning like that could mean your life 

A look conveying hope to the merciless cloudless sky
My leaves are brown and my rootstock is bone dry
But I can hear a sound in the distance
And now I feel that I've got no resistance
It's gonna come and it's gonna run me down
Like a bulldozer 

Bulldozer
It's gonna run me down
It's gonna run me down 

My fight is all gone and I got nothing left to give
This is surely not the way we were meant to live
Wearing down our human resources
We got no time to be scared or be cautious
Who keep the desert from the door 

They're moving in closer with the ugly ravenous machines
Laying down roads where the grass used to be so green
Who is gonna stop the erosion
There's just no way to contain this explosion
It's gonna come and it's gonna run me down
Like a bulldozer 

Bulldozer
It's gonna run me down
It's gonna run me down 

Your words will spinning like a kite caught in a gale
Knives would cut the cloth to take the wind out of my sails
Your words could break a bone
Your words flow like a stone
Your words could run right over me
Like a 

Reeling in the early evening haze
Safe from the sun's derisive gaze
Loose tongues are always a killer
Imagination's a surrogate filler
Who'll fix the damage once it's done? 

Stamping down tough on a ground that's drying hard
You're pushing for a mile when you know I only gave a yard
It's gonna take some time to repair it until then we just
Until then we'll just have to wear it
Never gonna let it run me down
Like a bulldozer 

Bulldozer
Never let it run me down
Never let it run me down 

Never let it
Run me down
Never let it
Run me down
