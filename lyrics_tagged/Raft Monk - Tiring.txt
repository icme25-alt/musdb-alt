Why won't it come to me?
How does it have to be?
Must I wait endlessly?
Or at least half a century? 

How long must I wait?
No more
It's tiring to keep fighting
Pretending that you're admiring
Tiring, tiring
Let it go 

How do I take control?
Find the fulfilling flow
How do I free my soul
How do I free my soul-oul 

How long must I wait
No more
It's tiring to keep fighting
Pretending that you're admiring
Tiring, tiring
Let it go 

Smiling, again smiling
Through the clouds I'm rising
Smiling, smiling
Let it go 

<nl> Oh-oh-oh-oh </nl>
<nl> Oh-oh-oh-oh </nl>
<nl> Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh </nl> 

Why won't it come to me?
Endlessly out of reach
How does it have to be?
It's tiring to keep fighting
Pretending that you're admiring
Tiring, tiring
Let it go
Smiling, again smiling
Through the clouds I'm rising
Smiling, smiling
Let it go 

Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
