Are we moving
Where the sun will always shine
Up and over
Where we first felt art divine 

Moving forward
Pick a road, follow the sign
Heading upward
To the sound afar I don't recognize
The warning sign 

You never see you never see
No matter how the future will be, future will be
We're heading back to where we come from, where we come from
We're the open
The outspoken
English actors 

To the catcher
I'm the catcher in the rye
Ode to Salinger
That the man not even try
To recognize
The heart inside 

You never see, you never see
No matter how the future will be, future will be
We're heading back to where we come from, where we come from
We're the open
Ill-spoken
English actors 

You never see, you never see
No matter how the future will be, future will be
We're heading back to where we come from, where we come from
We're the open
The ill-spoken  

You never see, you never see
No matter how the future will be, future will be
We're heading back to where we come from, where we come from
We're the open
The outspoken
English actors
