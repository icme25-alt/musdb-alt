I'm taking the keys, some time to think
Your name on my arm, commited to ink
The end of an anchor, I'm starting to sink
A hole in the sky, a world on the brink 

Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you really might be?
Who do you think you are?
Who do you
It's all I think I really know  

It's not you
It's totally me
<nl> Ya ya ya ya </nl>
It's not you
It's totally me
<nl> Ya ya ya ya </nl> 

Yeah as I'm walking around this terrible town
My head to the floor, my feet on the ground
I see you there, I start to stutter
Just another breath on the gutter  

Who do you think you are?
Who do you
I thought you really like me
Who do you think you are
Who to you
It's all I think I really know  

It's not you
It's totally me
<nl> Ya ya ya ya </nl>
It's not you
It's totally me
<nl> Ya ya ya ya </nl> 

You know you are think you are this won't hurt a bit
Know you are think you are you won't feel a thing
You know you are think you are this won't hurt a bit
Know you are think you are 

You know you are think you are this won't hurt a bit
Know you are think you are this won't feel a thing
Are think you are you won't hurt a bit
Know you are think you are 

It's not you 

It's not you (It's not you)
Staring at me
<nl> Ya ya ya ya </nl>
It's not you (It's you)
It's totally me (It's not me)
<nl> Ya ya ya ya </nl>
It's not me
It's me
