Just about 10 p.m. again, starting the show
I put in the blinds and the game is ready to go
American airlines, they saw me right through
When I get 'em I'm gonna check, raise back to you 

Shuffle 'em up
Deal 'em on down
I'm grinding it out tonight, I'm standing my ground 

And on the next hand, bullet rears it's head
I'm folding cowboys but one marked on me and I'm dead
A couple rounds later
We got the same pair
What's your kicker boy let's compare 

Shuffle 'em up
Deal 'em on down
I'm grinding it out tonight, I'm standing my ground 

I'm right about to win
The flop gives me the wheel
I'm holding both the high and the low
This pot big slick ain't gonna steal 

Shuffle 'em up
Deal 'em on down
I'm grinding it out tonight, I'm standing my ground 

Listen up son
I'm going all in
Cause I got the nuts there ain't no chance in hell you'll win
