20.89,24.60,She's got a mask painted deftly
24.60,27.89,Like curtains across her face
28.20,32.20,Sun is hiding beautiful black eyes
32.20,35.63,And everything's right in its place
35.63,39.86,He says you just can't walk out and leave me
40.20,43.40,You gotta pay your debt
43.91,46.91,You made your bed now you lie in it
47.66,50.51,And don't you ever forget
51.00,55.11,That I can settle this with a blind one
55.11,58.80,And you know you'll hang on to a touch
59.20,64.00,You never break free cause you know deep inside
64.00,66.20,"Girl, you love me too much"
68.52,71.91,She met him last year at the local
72.39,75.70,Lookin' so lonely and lost
76.20,80.01,And looking like life had sure changed him
80.01,83.20,And only she could make up the cost
83.50,87.53,She said I only wanna be near you
88.15,91.48,For every hour of the day
91.91,95.74,He looked right through already melted at heart
96.23,98.71,But there was nothing to say
99.20,102.79,Now it didn't take a long till he hit her  she
102.79,106.42,While he was leaning on his liquid crutch
106.65,111.06,She said I got to forgive you and it's probably my fault
111.06,114.06,"And boy, I love you too much"
153.22,156.84,She's going away down the road now
156.84,160.20,Into the great beyond
161.16,164.92,Who knows what she will find there
164.92,167.92,Who knows where she belongs
168.06,172.20,She said she's gonna kick over the traces
172.20,175.96,And this time she's gonna be strong
175.96,179.90,But she's looking in all the wrong faces
180.04,183.05,And she is just too far gone
183.66,187.56,Well it never takes long till they leave her
187.56,191.20,Stinging from the loneliest touch
191.20,195.51,Will she ever break free or just surrender again
195.51,199.02,You know it happens too much
