39.44,43.12,It's time to look back it's time to forget
43.12,46.41,Time to get checked all that's above the neck
46.41,49.41,Are the lucky ones those who never even born at all
53.67,57.27,The color's been bleached from out of the eyes
57.27,60.63,The marrow has started to caramelize
60.63,67.20,As I perish inside everyone else seems to thrive
67.56,74.95,And I cannot decide what it is to be alive
78.33,83.78,And into to myself I crawl into myself
83.78,87.37,I crawl into myself
87.37,90.78,Living is just not enough
90.78,94.66,"Just not enough, into to myself"
95.20,101.45,"I crawl into myself I crawl, into myself"
101.45,110.20,Living is just not enough just not enough
120.74,124.36,A mind is a terrible thing to be lost
124.36,127.77,A mind is a terrible thing full stop
127.77,133.18,Stop I cannot control the input and output commands
134.89,138.20,A lesion exists on the tissues that lie
138.20,141.77,On the brain that once lived but long since atrophied
141.77,148.20,As I perish inside everyone else seems to thrive
148.20,156.20,And I cannot decide what it is to be alive
159.43,165.04,And into myself I crawl into myself
165.20,168.77,I crawl into myself
168.77,172.00,Living is just not enough
172.00,175.84,"Just not enough, into myself"
179.20,182.64,I crawl into myself
182.64,188.36,"Living is just not enough, just not enough"
222.47,228.20,Raise your pulse
229.31,235.31,Breath to waste
236.33,243.20,The time is ripe
243.44,248.76,But still we sit
249.04,254.02,And wait
257.51,261.20,It's gone but
261.20,270.36,Still we wait
271.20,281.20,"For nothing. for nothing, nothing, stop"
285.73,289.27,It's time to look close time to inspect
289.27,292.73,The smallest of worlds where the miracle's kept
292.73,299.20,As I cherish this life everyone else seems to die
299.80,306.58,And I cannot decide what it is to be alive
306.98,314.20,I cannot decide what it is to be alive
314.20,319.18,I cannot decide what it is to be alive
