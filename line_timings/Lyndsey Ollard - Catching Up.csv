14.32,18.96,Why oh why won't someone tell me
20.63,25.00,God only knows what I should do
26.78,31.68,Now watch the world is moving forward
33.14,37.28,"But I am stuck, I can't push through"
39.63,43.53,I'm just catching up with yesterday
45.81,51.06,By tomorrow I'll be ready for today
51.84,57.00,And I'm just catching up with yesterday
58.23,64.19,"And I don't know what to do, no"
64.67,69.74,"A fragile girl, a broken woman"
70.89,75.37,These walls have closed in all around
77.02,82.73,And I'm trapped inside this hazy prism
83.13,87.99,And my heart is nowhere to be found
89.65,94.51,The clouds above about to thunder
95.89,100.55,In this stormy atmosphere
102.18,108.53,But by now I thought I'd be there
108.53,112.78,But the destination's what I fear
115.15,120.15,I'm just catching up with yesterday
121.27,127.22,By tomorrow I'll be ready for today
127.64,133.40,So I'm just catching up with yesterday
134.00,140.00,"And I don't know what to do, no"
140.00,146.00,Oh I can't shake this feeling
146.16,150.87,It steals contentment in my mind
152.58,157.27,And I keep looking for the answers
157.27,163.67,"Oh that I, that I just can't seem to find"
165.29,171.27,And I'm just catching up with yesterday
171.69,177.29,But by tomorrow I'll be ready for today
178.00,184.30,Said I'm just catching up with yesterday
184.42,190.44,"And I don't know what to do, no"
191.00,197.00,Oh I can't shake this feeling
197.47,201.71,Steals contentment in my mind
203.62,208.62,And I keep looking for the answers
208.62,217.00,"Oh that I, that I just can't seem to find"
