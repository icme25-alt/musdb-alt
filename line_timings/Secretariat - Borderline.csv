19.70,24.66,Maybe there's hope for the city come summer
24.66,29.24,When everything turns to green
29.58,39.00,Right now cold wind is more gray than I have ever seen
39.40,44.66,Maybe a company will come and rebuild where old houses rusted right through the frame
44.66,49.62,Where houses rusted right through to the frame
49.62,57.00,The signs put up no number no name
60.34,67.00,I would not say that everything's fine
70.12,79.00,That's just life on the border line
80.70,84.02,Too close to stay
85.68,89.50,Too far to leave
90.46,98.00,I guess that's just life on this border line
109.06,114.00,Somehow the colors of red wine and blue

118.96,124.00,Is the Canadian dollar strong enough
124.00,128.24,To buy a man a drink
128.70,133.98,Maybe the Native Americans will save
133.98,139.04,Three hotels in the center of town
139.04,147.00,Nine floors up one story down
202.22,208.76,I would not say that everything is fine
212.02,220.00,But that's just life on the borderline
221.78,229.00,I would not say that everything's fine
231.70,241.00,But that's just life on the border line
242.02,245.20,Too close to stay
247.08,250.96,Too far to leave
251.86,259.82,I guess that's just life on this border line
