6.46,14.34,Opened my eyes this morning
14.94,20.58,I saw three white horses
20.58,24.86,Pass my window
25.18,30.46,I want to run
30.46,35.54,I want to ride
35.60,41.64,And I want to fly
41.78,46.80,With those horses
49.24,56.92,I rode away from the city
58.04,67.00,And the horses led me to a valley
67.88,73.10,I want to glide
73.24,78.48,I want to fly
78.58,84.00,I want to soar
84.00,89.00,Through the sky
90.44,97.96,I don't wanna say goodbye
99.80,106.28,Close my eyes and let it go
106.60,114.18,I don't wanna say goodbye
115.84,122.64,Close my eyes and let it go
126.54,134.46,Lay down my head in the valley
135.50,140.80,And the sky closed over
140.86,145.16,Like curtains
145.28,150.36,I want to sleep
150.52,155.92,I want to dream
155.96,161.52,I want my dreams
161.58,166.64,To fly like horses
167.88,175.26,I don't wanna say good bye
177.16,183.70,Close my eyes and let it go
183.86,191.72,I don't wanna say goodbye
193.12,199.32,Close my eyes and let it go
204.80,212.24,With all of my desires and all I know
212.42,216.52,Surrendered
216.56,222.20,I will say goodbye
223.42,230.92,With all of my desires and all I know
231.00,235.00,Surrendered
235.28,239.92,I will say goodbye
239.92,247.38,I don't wanna say goodbye
249.12,255.72,Close my eyes and let it go
255.92,265.08,I don't wanna say goodbye (With all of my desires and all I know)
265.18,274.53,Close my eyes and let it go (Surrendered I will say goodbye)
274.53,283.80,I don't wanna say goodbye (With all of my desires and all I know)
283.83,293.00,Close my eyes and let it go (Surrendered I will say goodbye)
