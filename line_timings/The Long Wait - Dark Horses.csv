37.62,40.38,Pleased to meet dan collins
40.38,44.89,Old blind drunk and falling he's falling in the street
45.13,47.20,Just tryna' find his feet
48.51,51.64,And here comes wife Eudora
51.64,56.20,She can't take much more but she still follows him around
56.20,59.42,And helps him to the ground

81.47,85.20,Woman you can put that righteous mess on hold
85.78,88.80,Cause I can stand up on my own
89.89,92.73,And you can hear her pleading
92.73,96.89,Well Dan now I was only trying to help
97.53,99.93,So you can go to hell
100.71,105.20,You put love and a bag of dope in a grocery cart
106.62,112.20,In any universe she'd still have given him her heart
112.20,116.84,They were always meant to be and that's the truth

168.20,174.33,In all his silliness she still remembers this
174.33,184.89,A long damn time ago when there were still dark horses out along the open road
186.42,189.33,Grocery cart they push out
189.33,193.20,Broadway up to craycroft he's yelling at the cars
193.71,196.71,Under arizona stars
