38.31,43.20,This is my last chance
43.84,47.16,The highest point on earth
47.16,51.07,And I could be the first man
51.07,56.20,Twice now I've left home
56.58,59.91,And twice I have returned
59.91,65.18,A failure here's a third and last
83.04,88.20,Mountain of my mind
88.62,91.91,I hear you call my name
91.91,95.07,And know I must return
95.07,98.07,Soon this is
98.20,101.18,My last chance
101.44,104.78,The highest point on earth
104.78,110.20,And I could be the first man there
115.78,118.47,On the sky line
119.09,121.47,There's a silhouette
122.20,124.89,It's the last time
125.33,127.89,We will see you
128.69,131.00,In the future
131.82,134.62,They will find your bones
135.07,137.51,For the moment
138.27,141.00,You're not going home
141.42,143.87,As the clouds start
144.67,147.56,Closing in again
147.56,150.20,We say farewell
150.96,153.78,For the last time
187.40,190.43,Don't forget me
190.77,193.63,Don't forget me
194.31,198.79,The mountain side has claimed us
200.27,203.33,Don't forget me
203.33,206.20,Don't forget me
207.11,212.44,The mountain side has claimed our lies
227.45,231.12,You're my last hope
231.12,234.12,In the sky line
234.12,236.84,There's a silhouette
237.53,239.84,It's the last time
240.36,243.31,That we will see you
