9.58,15.34,While the colors saturate my mind
19.47,27.11,Everyone is dancing on this serotonin high
31.45,39.47,This unmistakable feeling of my actual size
40.31,46.75,Freedom is clearly on the other side
50.40,56.70,Freedom is clearly in front of my eyes
57.23,66.25,It's much too bright
67.13,76.29,Color my mind
77.00,84.83,See inside my eyes my eyes
86.96,96.00,They never lie
97.41,99.82,It's true
108.40,113.91,Searing silence eating its own way
118.19,124.05,Itching feelings how long will this take

146.39,155.29,It's much too bright
156.17,165.34,Color my mind

204.31,209.38,There's nothing wrong at all
210.37,214.00,I need some more
214.37,219.87,Now I just overdose
221.10,223.90,On you
225.47,234.66,It's much too bright
235.33,244.46,Color my mind
245.21,253.14,See inside my eyes my eyes
255.23,264.50,They never lie
