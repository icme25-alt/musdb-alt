19.84,24.84,Not the first time you say
25.49,29.22,"One day you'd pack up your things, leave town"
29.22,33.69,And go away
33.82,37.56,Sick and tired of this mundane life
37.56,41.78,Need something else to feel alive
41.78,45.93,So baby why don't we hit the road
45.93,49.33,Tonight
50.20,54.67,We could drive till the car breaks down
54.67,58.40,Disappear and never be found
58.40,66.47,"Take a road that goes out of bounds <nl> woah-oh, woah-oh </nl>"
66.47,71.20,That goes out of bounds
74.95,79.36,Heading south on our favorite tunes
79.36,83.64,High on life and above the rules
83.64,89.87,"Living every moment, we've got nothing to lose"
90.76,95.35,And if trouble comes our way
95.35,100.96,We'll turn it around and fade away now
100.96,105.57,We'll let nothing take us down
105.57,111.53,Yeah we could drive till the car breaks down
111.53,115.53,Disappear and never be found
115.53,123.47,"Take a road that goes out of bounds <nl> woah-oh, woah-oh </nl>"
123.47,127.90,We can't stop we can't sleep
127.90,131.33,Never coming down
131.33,136.20,"We can't stop, we can't sleep"
136.20,143.20,Let's make this the best time of our lives
143.80,147.67,Of our lives
147.97,155.20,"Of our lives, of our lives"
156.17,160.20,We could drive till the car breaks down
160.20,164.70,Disappear and never be found
164.70,168.60,Take a road that goes out of bounds
168.60,172.44,That goes out of bounds
172.53,176.93,"We can't stop, we can't sleep"
176.93,180.40,Never coming down
180.40,185.20,We can't stop we can't sleep
185.20,193.20,Let's make this the best time of our lives (We can't stop we can't sleep)
193.20,201.20,Let's make this the best time of our lives (We can't stop we can't sleep)
