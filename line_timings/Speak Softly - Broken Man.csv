3.09,10.80,Unwinding us like string cut away the rot
11.43,19.00,Weeding out the thorns unraveling the knot
20.30,28.05,Let me unfold this map trace my finger down the path
29.10,36.85,Try to find my way back to where you are
37.70,44.85,And your fears may never come
46.00,54.00,These years have come undone
54.90,62.65,Your fears may never come
63.50,71.25,And these years have come undone
72.90,80.25,Broken man will I have to be
80.25,85.00,Always on my knees
85.03,93.00,To make you feel tall give you room to breathe
93.75,102.00,Will I never have just a sip of your love
102.00,111.00,In case I waste it in case I spill it on the floor
111.00,119.00,And your fears may never come
120.05,127.55,These years have come undone
128.00,136.00,Your fears may never come
137.05,144.30,And these years have come undone
146.50,155.75,Broken man I won't ask you to give
157.45,162.35,It's too much for you to pay
163.30,172.10,From empty hands
172.10,179.26,And your fears may never come
180.45,187.51,These years have come undone
188.90,196.16,Your fears may never come
197.77,204.90,And these years have come undone
206.46,213.59,And your fears may never come
215.07,222.32,These years have come undone
223.49,231.04,Your fears may never come
232.40,239.61,And these years have come undone
241.49,244.71,Broken man
