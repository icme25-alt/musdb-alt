27.20,31.20,Burning in the early morning heat
33.26,36.69,Determined to stay on my feet
38.66,41.17,It's hard to be a tree in the desert
41.17,43.86,Expediency makes sense if you let it
43.86,47.60,Reasoning like that could mean your life
49.14,54.20,A look conveying hope to the merciless cloudless sky
54.80,59.71,My leaves are brown and my rootstock is bone dry
60.77,63.63,But I can hear a sound in the distance
63.63,66.20,And now I feel that I've got no resistance
66.20,69.77,It's gonna come and it's gonna run me down
70.43,72.29,Like a bulldozer
76.31,79.26,Bulldozer
81.74,87.37,It's gonna run me down
87.37,92.20,It's gonna run me down
93.31,97.17,My fight is all gone and I got nothing left to give
99.23,102.80,This is surely not the way we were meant to live
105.06,107.69,Wearing down our human resources
107.69,110.46,We got no time to be scared or be cautious
110.46,113.69,Who keep the desert from the door
115.60,119.26,They're moving in closer with the ugly ravenous machines
121.29,125.83,Laying down roads where the grass used to be so green
127.09,129.74,Who is gonna stop the erosion
129.74,132.49,There's just no way to contain this explosion
132.49,136.20,It's gonna come and it's gonna run me down
136.63,138.46,Like a bulldozer
142.54,145.46,Bulldozer
147.63,153.57,It's gonna run me down
153.57,158.54,It's gonna run me down
165.51,170.20,Your words will spinning like a kite caught in a gale
170.20,176.20,Knives would cut the cloth to take the wind out of my sails
176.20,179.37,Your words could break a bone
179.37,182.20,Your words flow like a stone
182.20,186.74,Your words could run right over me
186.74,187.71,Like a
242.57,246.43,Reeling in the early evening haze
248.29,252.37,Safe from the sun's derisive gaze
253.91,256.71,Loose tongues are always a killer
256.71,259.20,Imagination's a surrogate filler
259.20,263.20,Who'll fix the damage once it's done?
264.51,268.57,Stamping down tough on a ground that's drying hard
270.26,273.83,You're pushing for a mile when you know I only gave a yard
275.83,278.66,It's gonna take some time to repair it until then we just
278.66,281.51,Until then we'll just have to wear it
281.51,284.77,Never gonna let it run me down
285.63,287.77,Like a bulldozer
291.26,294.37,Bulldozer
296.91,302.66,Never let it run me down
302.66,307.60,Never let it run me down
318.86,320.34,Never let it
321.83,324.43,Run me down
324.71,325.74,Never let it
326.57,329.54,Run me down
