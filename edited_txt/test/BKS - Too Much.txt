She's got a mask painted deftly
Like curtains across her face
Sun is hiding beautiful black eyes
And everything's right in its place
He says you just can't walk out and leave me
You gotta pay your debt
You made your bed now you lie in it
And don't you ever forget
That I can settle this with a blind one
And you know you'll hang on to a touch
You never break free cause you know deep inside
Girl, you love me too much 

She met him last year at the local
Lookin' so lonely and lost
And looking like life had sure changed him
And only she could make up the cost
She said I only wanna be near you
For every hour of the day
He looked right through already melted at heart
But there was nothing to say
Now it didn't take a long till he hit her  she
While he was leaning on his liquid crutch
She said I got to forgive you and it's probably my fault
And boy, I love you too much 

She's going away down the road now
Into the great beyond
Who knows what she will find there
Who knows where she belongs
She said she's gonna kick over the traces
And this time she's gonna be strong
But she's looking in all the wrong faces
And she is just too far gone 

Well it never takes long till they leave her
Stinging from the loneliest touch
Will she ever break free or just surrender again
You know it happens too much
