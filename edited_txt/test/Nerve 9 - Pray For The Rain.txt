I saw you staring at me
And I knew you didn't care
Your smile told me I was one night
I should have never showed up there
Now I pray for the rain to wash it away (Wash it all away)
Cause I know in my heart
You won't be there 

Babe you're gonna get what's coming your way
And then you'll know and feel my pain
All the honesty and hope that you just threw away
You are so vain 

Now I pray for the rain to wash it away (Pray for the rain)
To wash it away (Wash it all away)
Cause I know in my heart (My heart)
You won't be there and I won't (Wait)
Wait for the day (For the day)
To hear you say (You say)
That you're sorry from the heart (Heart)
You weren't playing fair 

Now the time has come
And you want more than you've shown
There's no one waiting
Your empty past is known
There's nothing left
Regret it hits real hard
You've pulled this all upon yourself you can't erase it
You can't erase it 

So you pray for the rain (For the rain)
To wash it away (Wash it all away)
Cause you know in your heart (Your heart)
It's still in there (Your heart)
So you wait for the day (For the day)
For someone to stay (Someone to stay)
And love you (Love you)
But no one cares
