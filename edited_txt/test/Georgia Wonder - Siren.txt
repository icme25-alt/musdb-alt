Just give in, there's no getting away from me
Such a perfect night
Silent to my lies
Take my head there's nothing you can say to me
When you hear my voice
Then you have no choice  

I'd cross my heart, I tell no lies
I see your future in my eyes
I promise you a love so deep
You'll hear me calling in your sleep
Who needs to breathe the air above?
When we're both drowning in my love
The tides have turned, don't be afraid
You're not the only soul I've saved 

Come to me, come to me
Help me to love you
Come to me, come to me
Help me to love you
Come to me, come to me
Help me to love you
Come to me, come to me
Help me to love you 

Close your eyes, the tide'll bring you here with me
We can be so calm
Sink into my arms
Hold on tight, you only wanna be with me
On a broken shore
Now and ever more 

I'd cross my heart, I tell no lies
I see your future in my eyes
I promise you a love so deep
You'll hear me calling in your sleep
Who needs to breathe the air above?
When we're both drowning in my love
The tides have turned, don't be afraid
You're not the only soul I've saved 

Come to me, come to me
Help me to love you
Come to me, come to
Help me to love you
Come to me, come to me
Help me to love you
Come to me, come to me
Help me to love you 

Come to me
Come to me, come to me, come to me
Come to me, come to me, come to me 

Come to me
Come to me, come to me, come to me
Come to me
Come to me 

Come to me, come to me
Help me to love you
Come to me, come to me
Help me to love you
Come to me, come to me
Help me to love you
Come to me, come to me
Help me to love you
