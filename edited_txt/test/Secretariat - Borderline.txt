Maybe there's hope for the city come summer
When everything turns to green
Right now cold wind is more gray than I have ever seen
Maybe a company will come and rebuild where old houses rusted right through the frame
Where houses rusted right through to the frame
The signs put up no number no name 

I would not say that everything's fine
That's just life on the border line
Too close to stay
Too far to leave
I guess that's just life on this border line 

Somehow the colors of red wine and blue
Have bled into old pink
Is the Canadian dollar strong enough
To buy a man a drink
Maybe the Native Americans will save
Three hotels in the center of town
Nine floors up one story down 

I would not say that everything is fine
But that's just life on the borderline
I would not say that everything's fine
But that's just life on the border line
Too close to stay
Too far to leave
I guess that's just life on this border line
