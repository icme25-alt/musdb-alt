I will, I will shed a tear
But not for you
I will live in fear
For the people I hold dear
I hope they never see my hate 

You, you make me sick
You, you make me sick 

Now you, you live under a rock
And who's gonna be there
To dig you out?
Not me 

I'll be satisfied knowing that I tried
This is for all the times
That you fucking lied 

No more chances
You've crossed the line
One too many times
Look at you
Hang your head in shame
Was this a a game? 

You, you make me sick
Whatever made you think we share
The same ill fate? 

You, you make me sick
Whatever made you think we share
The same ill fate? 

You fall deeper and deeper
Each step takes you closer to death
I'll be satisfied
Knowing that I tried
