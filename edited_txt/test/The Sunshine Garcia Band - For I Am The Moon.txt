Rolling along the ice of faith
For continuous thoughts I can escape
I didn't know I had so much time to contemplate
Blessed with the days to rejuvenate 

For I am the ocean
Rushing in and out I've got missions and missions that makes even god shout
For I am the moon
I belong in the sky
Tell me what life's worth if I'm not riding high 

Finely pounding with pulses of love
Honest to fear, demanding communication
Breathing his warm neck and caressing his short hair (Could this be love, and be love)
Could this be love bob sings in my 

For I am the ocean
Rushing in and out
I've got missions and missions that makes my god proud
For I am the moon
I belong up in the sky
Tell me what is a life's worth if I'm not
Riding high
Oh high 

Could this be love he whispers in my ear woah-oh
Oh, oh, rolling along the ice of faith
For continuous thoughts I can't escape
I didn't know I had so much time to contemplate oh
Blessed with the days to rejuvenate 

For I am the ocean
Rushing rushing in and out and I've got missions and missions that makes my god proud for
For I am the moon
I belong up in the sky, ooh
Tell me what life's worth if I'm not
Riding high, oh yeah 

I've got to ride high baby
I've got to ride high honey
Ooh watch me flying
Gonna ride high ooh
Oh yeah (Riding)
Ooh
