I miss you so much boy
I don't know what I would do with myself
If you are gone
Far away from home
I don't know how many times I've fallen
And honestly I lost count long ago
But you have always been there to pull me back up on my feet
Oh I can't dare stop lord
On my lips is nothing but the sweet and truthful faith in our love
I know that you can save me I know
I know that you can find me when I'm lost
When I'm lost 

I miss you so badly
I don't know if I'm even thinking straight
I'm feeling numb
Oh I can taste your love
On my skin is nothing but the sweet and dying faith in our love
I know that you can save me I know
I know that you can heal me when I'm lost
When I'm lost 

<nl> (Oh-oh-oh-oh) </nl> I know I've let you down before and that I've hurt you bad
I know that sorry will not cut it but I can swear I'll try
<nl> (Oh-oh-oh-oh) </nl> To tear the world apart if that's a way to find you and a place for us to fall back down <nl> (Oh-oh-oh-oh) </nl>
A place for us to fall asleep in sound <nl> (Oh-oh-oh) </nl>
I'll take the world apart <nl> (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) </nl>
Without a change of heart <nl> (Oh-oh-oh) </nl>
