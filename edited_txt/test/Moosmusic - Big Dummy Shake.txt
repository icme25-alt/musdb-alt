Baby's got a puzzle and I'm gonna scratch through her skin
Gonna keep it all in then fight about it every night
Oh every night
See she got a brand new friend gonna pay her all bills gonna have a good time
Reminisce about the better ones
<nl> Woah </nl> better ones
Cause this is so serious it ain't right
Do your big dummy shake and pull it back again
Oh I'm back again 

Went to the party-arty, we came back before time
This is nothing but a joke I'll be thinking of the rest of night
<nl> Woah </nl>  the rest of night
See she's got a brand new song she just sings it too loud
But I make it alright if I walk away every time
<nl> Woah </nl> every time
Cause this is so serious it ain't right
Do your big dummy shake and pull it back again
Oh I'm back again 

And if it's all just the same to you
Then could you tell me truly are you human
And if it's all just the same to you
Then could you tell me truly are you human 

Baby's had a bad bad day it would seem we have  to pay
For the pleasure of peace for a place in the sweetest seats
<nl> Woah </nl>  sweetest seats
See she's got a brand new song she just sings it too loud
But I make it alright if I walk away every time
<nl> Woah </nl>  every time 

Cause this is so serious it ain't right
Do your big dummy shake and pull it back again
Oh I'm back again 

Cause this is so serious it ain't right
Do your big dummy shake and pull it back again
Oh I'm back again
Oh
