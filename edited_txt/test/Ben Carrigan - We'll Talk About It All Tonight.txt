No diamond sparkles in slumbered hands
Deserving arms adore
Oh mister wallflowers who loves to dance
Is wary of the floor
I'm slowing down
Let's talk about you
Can't spot the wood from the trees, in overtime
(Talk it out tonight) We'll talk about it all tonight 

A wayward thought locked this heart in flame
To burn another way
Where winds wield wildly here, water tames
And night becomes the day
I'm slowing down
Let's talk about you
Can't spot the wood from the trees, in overtime
(Talk it out tonight) We'll talk about it all tonight

Bell rings and he's home, there's shards on the floor
Standing there all alone, bloodied feet at the door
Head hung, his eyes stained with thoughts of before
Downcast by the rain, the shame that he wore
Come in and get warm, said friend to his foe
Not a great time of year, not a great time to go
Put yourself by the fire, like ducks in a row
I'm sure you are tired 

(Talk it out tonight) We'll talk about it all tonight
(Talk it out tonight) Talk about it all tonight
(Talk it out tonight) Talk about it all tonight
(Talk it out tonight) Talk about it all tonight
