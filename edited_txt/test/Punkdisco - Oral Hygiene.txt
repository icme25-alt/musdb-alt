What you gonna do that for
I thought I told you not to
Now I'm gonna have to clean my teeth
I'm not that sort of girl 

Now I'm gonna have to clean my teeth
I'm not that sort of girl 

It was just the same as the last time
And the time before and the time before
It was just the same as the last time
And the time before and the time before 

What you gonna that for
I thought I told you not to
Now I'm gonna have to clean  my teeth
I'm not that sort of girl 

Sort of girl
Sort of girl
Sort of girl
Sort of girl 

What you gonna do that for
I though I told you not to
Oh come on that's not fair I trusted you
Now I'm gonna have to clean my teeth 

I'm not that sort of girl
Oh that's so gross
It was just the same as the last time (What you gonna do that for)
I thought I told you not to (And the time before and the time before)
That's horrible
Now I'm gonna have to clean my teeth (It was just the same as the last time)
I feel sick now
It was just the same as the last time ( I'm not that sort of girl)  

It was just the same as the last time
It was just the same as the last time
Just the same as the last time
And the time before and the time before
It was just the same as the last time
And the time before and the time before
