It's time to look back it's time to forget
Time to get checked all that's above the neck
Are the lucky ones those who never even born at all
The color's been bleached from out of the eyes
The marrow has started to caramelize
As I perish inside everyone else seems to thrive
And I cannot decide what it is to be alive 

And into to myself I crawl into myself
I crawl into myself
Living is just not enough
Just not enough, into to myself
I crawl into myself I crawl, into myself
Living is just not enough just not enough 

A mind is a terrible thing to be lost
A mind is a terrible thing full stop
Stop I cannot control the input and output commands
A lesion exists on the tissues that lie
On the brain that once lived but long since atrophied
As I perish inside everyone else seems to thrive
And I cannot decide what it is to be alive 

And into myself I crawl into myself
I crawl into myself
Living is just not enough
Just not enough, into myself
I crawl into myself
Living is just not enough, just not enough 

Raise your pulse
Breath to waste
The time is ripe
But still we sit
And wait
It's gone but
Still we wait
For nothing. for nothing, nothing, stop 

It's time to look close time to inspect
The smallest of worlds where the miracle's kept
As I cherish this life everyone else seems to die 

And I cannot decide what it is to be alive
I cannot decide what it is to be alive
I cannot decide what it is to be alive
