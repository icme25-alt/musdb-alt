Take one big bite of life to go
Take an apple please, from the front row
Oh soon enough never good enough
Inch by inch come on, come on connect the dots 

Yeah, keep keep keep me in your line of sight
Squeeze squeeze squeeze me go on hold me tight
Close close close until you're kissable
Get get gets you in my heart's peripheral 

Toes in toes out, I'm on stand by
Now we're testing out our wings for flight
There's no luck in letting it roll
Choose lets choose, come on and let me know
