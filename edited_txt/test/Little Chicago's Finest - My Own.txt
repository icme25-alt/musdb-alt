I thought we was fit for business
What's hot with you blowin' kisses
It's not what it really seems
The truth is not in these bitches
You find yourself building bridges it's crazy the way we
They fall just like heydy hit 'em
You feel like a heydy victim
It's crazy the way we give in
I know the time and the time is now  told that girl
There was time for me and her but that time ran out
Remember all the times that I ran my mouth
I'm going to make it and she laughed, like how?
Then I really started to figure it out
Really thought I was living now I'm living without her
Now I feel like the greatest on the earth
And I knew the end was coming, Mayan calendar

Me and you girl, coulda been the perfect fit
But you had to do your best, put on and flip a trick
Now it's on to the next one, just another hit
I'ma never get enough so you know I never quit
Trying to bring me down but I climb to the top
Had my head all in the mix and now it feels severed off
I'ma break through these binds just to make it on my own
Show you what I'm on, every night to the morn
We had it on lock girl it's such a tragedy
We hit it off hard it turned to a catastrophe
Watch you walk off just to claim another casualty
I knocked the dirt off while I'm moving on casually
What doesn't take me out only makes me stronger
Face it piece by piece, till it's art like the Mona yeah
You might have took a chip up off my shoulder
But I promise I'ma keep on going till it's over 'cause

I'm good on my own, I don't need you
You think you got me down but this what I'ma do
I'ma show how a real man do it when he move on, kick it like a villain
You took me straight down went  wrong like a sin
But I had a rebound cause I'm going for the win
And I'ma live it up let the party begin
It's a celebration now, damn right, fuck the past
The show will never last that won't  be a punching bag
I know what it's worth in the ring, enough cash
To make me reconsider being free at last
So hey how you doing to the opposite sex
I know what you need and you gotta get next
A new night with me and you're not a bit stressed
But makes you see like the view from a jet, that
