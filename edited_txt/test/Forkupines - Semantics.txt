So here we are not making a scene
Cause that is what it's all about it seems
We cannot live like that 

The great responsibility
That everything must come to be
Nothing ever sets in noise 

How could you say
That everyone needs
To swing and sway
Like you do 

Another verdict breaks the case
Another route might end the chase
But never give up your hope 

How could you say
That everyone needs
To swing and sway
Like you do 

Abysmal skin coming undone
This life is worth a living
After all 

You can't clean anything up
Without messing up something else
But everything's worth a try
She gets me high 

How could you say
That everyone needs
To swing and sway
Like you do 

How could you say
That everyone needs
To swing and sway
Like you do 

How could you say
That everyone needs
To swing and sway
Like you do 

How could you say
