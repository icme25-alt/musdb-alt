This is my last chance
The highest point on earth
And I could be the first man
Twice now I've left home
And twice I have returned
A failure here's a third and last 

Mountain of my mind
I hear you call my name
And know I must return
Soon this is
My last chance
The highest point on earth
And I could be the first man there 

On the sky line
There's a silhouette
It's the last time
We will see you
In the future
They will find your bones
For the moment
You're not going home
As the clouds start
Closing in again
We say farewell
For the last time 

Don't forget me
Don't forget me
The mountain side has claimed us
Don't forget me
Don't forget me
The mountain side has claimed our lies 

You're my last hope
In the sky line
There's a silhouette
It's the last time
That we will see you
