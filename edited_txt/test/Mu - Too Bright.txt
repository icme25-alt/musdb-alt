While the colors saturate my mind
Everyone is dancing on this serotonin high
This unmistakable feeling of my actual size
Freedom is clearly on the other side
Freedom is clearly in front of my eyes 

It's much too bright
Color my mind
See inside my eyes my eyes
They never lie
It's true 

Searing silence eating its own way
Itching feelings how long will this take
Disembodied voices
They echo it's too late
This life of reason when will it break 

It's much too bright
Color my mind
See inside my eyes my eyes
They never lie
It's true 

Oh I feel it call
There's nothing wrong at all
I need some more
Now I just overdose
On you 

It's much too bright
Color my mind
See inside my eyes my eyes
They never lie
