Not the first time you say
One day you'd pack up your things, leave town
And go away
Sick and tired of this mundane life
Need something else to feel alive
So baby why don't we hit the road
Tonight 

We could drive till the car breaks down
Disappear and never be found
Take a road that goes out of bounds <nl> woah-oh, woah-oh </nl>
That goes out of bounds 

Heading south on our favorite tunes
High on life and above the rules
Living every moment, we've got nothing to lose
And if trouble comes our way
We'll turn it around and fade away now
We'll let nothing take us down 

Yeah we could drive till the car breaks down
Disappear and never be found
Take a road that goes out of bounds <nl> woah-oh, woah-oh </nl> 

We can't stop we can't sleep
Never coming down
We can't stop, we can't sleep
Let's make this the best time of our lives
Of our lives
Of our lives, of our lives 

We could drive till the car breaks down
Disappear and never be found
Take a road that goes out of bounds
That goes out of bounds 

We can't stop, we can't sleep
Never coming down
We can't stop we can't sleep 

Let's make this the best time of our lives (We can't stop we can't sleep)
Let's make this the best time of our lives (We can't stop we can't sleep)
Let's make this the best time of our lives (We can't stop we can't sleep)
Let's make this the best time of our lives (We can't stop we can't sleep)
Let's make this the best time of our lives
