Lights off, getting lost, moving with the ticking clock
All night, bright-eyed, so we can say that we tried
This fights show blast, they say we can't I think we might let them all down 

We're on a fast track away from reality
Everything's blurry like it's meant to be
We're on a fast track away from reality 

We're on a fast track away from reality
Everything's blurry like it's meant to be
We're on a fast track away from reality
If we could stay here, why just stay with me 

We're all the young ones don't throw it away
Do what you want to like it's your last day
You've so much to live for, who cares what they say
It's a bright shiny world and it's all yours to take
Don't regret the past make it last 

And it's a black out
That feels so right
No turning back now if you want to take it then take it tonight 

And it's a black out
That feels so right
No turning back now if life's what you make it then make it feel right 

(Oh-ah-ah-oh) we're falling we're falling through
(Oh-ah-ah-oh-oh) we've nothing nothing to prove
This is the first time I felt so I felt so like nothing could stop us like they'd never catch us
(Oh-ah-ah-oh-oh) we're falling we're falling through
(Oh-ah-ah-oh) we've nothing nothing to prove
The first time I felt so I felt so like nothing could stop us, let them try to catch try to to catch heart beats 

One big daydream
Sky for a ceiling
Breathe breathe let it be breathe and take in everything heartbeats
One big day dream
Sky for a ceiling
Breathe breathe let it be, breathe and take in every little thing 

(It's all) it's all yours to take
(It's all)  it's all yours to take 

We're all the young ones don't throw it away
Do what you want to like it's your last day
Cause you've so much to live for who cares what they say
It's a bright shiny world and it's all yours to take
We're all the young ones don't throw it away 

Heartbeats
One big daydream
Sky for a ceiling
Let them all down
