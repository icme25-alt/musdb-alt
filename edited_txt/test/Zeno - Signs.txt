Calm collective devils
That revel
For a fight
A light
Burning through the night
Calling us on
On home 

This is our side
We are saved by our maker
We live life alive
This is our crime
The final nail in our coffin
Of all that is right 

Lines of sunlight glow
Through cloudy skies
My eyes
Realize
That all this world
Conforms to no sides 

This is a sign
We are saved by our maker
We'd live life alive
If this is our crime
The final nail in our coffin
Of all that is right 

Shine
Shine
Shine
A light
A light
A light
Of god 

This is a sign
We are saved by our maker
We'd live life alive
This is our crime
The final nail in our coffin
Of all that is right
