445,5.96,14.84,Opened my eyes this morning
446,14.44,20.58,I saw three white horses
447,20.58,25.08,Pass my window
448,24.96,30.46,I want to run
449,30.46,35.54,I want to ride
450,35.6,41.68,And I want to fly
451,41.74,47.3,With those horses
452,48.74,57.42,I rode away from the city
453,57.54,67.5,And the horses led me to a valley
454,67.38,73.14,I want to glide
455,73.19999999999999,78.48,I want to fly
456,78.58,84.0,I want to soar
457,84.0,89.5,Through the sky
458,89.94,98.46,I don't wanna say goodbye
459,99.3,106.5,Close my eyes and let it go
460,106.38,114.68,I don't wanna say goodbye
461,115.34,123.14,Close my eyes and let it go
462,126.04,134.96,Lay down my head in the valley
463,135.0,140.8,And the sky closed over
464,140.86,145.18,Like curtains
465,145.26,150.42000000000002,I want to sleep
466,150.46,155.92,I want to dream
467,155.96,161.52,I want my dreams
468,161.58,167.14,To fly like horses
469,167.38,175.76,I don't wanna say good bye
470,176.66,183.76000000000002,Close my eyes and let it go
