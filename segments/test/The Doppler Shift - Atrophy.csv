584,38.94,43.12,It's time to look back it's time to forget
585,43.12,46.41,Time to get checked all that's above the neck
586,46.41,49.91,Are the lucky ones those who never even born at all
587,53.17,57.27,The color's been bleached from out of the eyes
588,57.27,60.63,The marrow has started to caramelize
589,60.63,67.46000000000001,As I perish inside everyone else seems to thrive
590,67.3,75.45,And I cannot decide what it is to be alive
591,77.83,83.78,And into to myself I crawl into myself
592,83.78,87.37,I crawl into myself
593,87.37,90.78,Living is just not enough
594,90.78,95.10000000000001,"Just not enough, into to myself"
595,94.75999999999999,101.45,"I crawl into myself I crawl, into myself"
596,101.45,110.7,Living is just not enough just not enough
597,120.24,124.36,A mind is a terrible thing to be lost
598,124.36,127.77,A mind is a terrible thing full stop
599,127.77,133.68,Stop I cannot control the input and output commands
600,134.39,138.2,A lesion exists on the tissues that lie
601,138.2,141.77,On the brain that once lived but long since atrophied
602,141.77,148.2,As I perish inside everyone else seems to thrive
603,148.2,156.7,And I cannot decide what it is to be alive
604,158.93,165.1,And into myself I crawl into myself
605,165.14,168.77,I crawl into myself
606,168.77,172.0,Living is just not enough
607,172.0,176.34,"Just not enough, into myself"
608,178.7,182.64,I crawl into myself
609,182.64,188.86,"Living is just not enough, just not enough"
610,221.97,228.7,Raise your pulse
611,228.81,235.81,Breath to waste
612,235.83,243.34,The time is ripe
613,243.29999999999998,248.94,But still we sit
614,248.85999999999999,254.52,And wait
615,257.01,261.2,It's gone but
616,261.2,270.86,Still we wait
617,270.7,281.7,"For nothing. for nothing, nothing, stop"
618,285.23,289.27,It's time to look close time to inspect
619,289.27,292.73,The smallest of worlds where the miracle's kept
620,292.73,299.7,As I cherish this life everyone else seems to die
621,299.3,306.88,And I cannot decide what it is to be alive
622,306.68,314.2,I cannot decide what it is to be alive
623,314.2,319.68,I cannot decide what it is to be alive
