624,19.34,25.34,Not the first time you say
625,24.99,29.22,"One day you'd pack up your things, leave town"
626,29.22,33.72,And go away
627,33.79,37.56,Sick and tired of this mundane life
628,37.56,41.78,Need something else to feel alive
629,41.78,45.93,So baby why don't we hit the road
630,45.93,49.83,Tonight
631,49.7,54.67,We could drive till the car breaks down
632,54.67,58.4,Disappear and never be found
633,58.4,66.47,"Take a road that goes out of bounds <nl> woah-oh, woah-oh </nl>"
634,66.47,71.7,That goes out of bounds
635,74.45,79.36,Heading south on our favorite tunes
636,79.36,83.64,High on life and above the rules
637,83.64,90.37,"Living every moment, we've got nothing to lose"
638,90.26,95.35,And if trouble comes our way

643,115.53,123.47,"Take a road that goes out of bounds <nl> woah-oh, woah-oh </nl>"
644,123.47,127.9,We can't stop we can't sleep
645,127.9,131.33,Never coming down
646,131.33,136.2,"We can't stop, we can't sleep"
647,136.2,143.7,Let's make this the best time of our lives
648,143.3,147.87,Of our lives
649,147.76999999999998,155.7,"Of our lives, of our lives"
650,155.67,160.2,We could drive till the car breaks down
