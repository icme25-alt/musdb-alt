1239,19.2,24.66,Maybe there's hope for the city come summer
1240,24.66,29.479999999999997,When everything turns to green
1241,29.34,39.3,Right now cold wind is more gray than I have ever seen
1242,39.1,44.66,Maybe a company will come and rebuild where old houses rusted right through the frame
1243,44.66,49.62,Where houses rusted right through to the frame
1244,49.62,57.5,The signs put up no number no name
1245,59.84,67.5,I would not say that everything's fine
1246,69.62,79.5,That's just life on the border line
1247,80.2,84.52,Too close to stay
1248,85.18,90.0,Too far to leave
1249,89.96,98.5,I guess that's just life on this border line
1250,108.56,114.0,Somehow the colors of red wine and blue
1251,114.0,118.86,Have bled into old pink
1252,118.94,124.0,Is the Canadian dollar strong enough
1253,124.0,128.6,To buy a man a drink
1254,128.34,133.98,Maybe the Native Americans will save
1255,133.98,139.04,Three hotels in the center of town
1256,139.04,147.5,Nine floors up one story down
1257,201.72,209.26,I would not say that everything is fine
1258,211.52,220.5,But that's just life on the borderline
1259,221.28,229.5,I would not say that everything's fine
1260,231.2,241.5,But that's just life on the border line
1261,241.52,245.7,Too close to stay
1262,246.58,251.46,Too far to leave
1263,251.36,260.32,I guess that's just life on this border line
