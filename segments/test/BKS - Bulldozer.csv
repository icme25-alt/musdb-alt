732,26.7,31.7,Burning in the early morning heat
733,32.76,37.19,Determined to stay on my feet
734,38.16,41.17,It's hard to be a tree in the desert
735,41.17,43.86,Expediency makes sense if you let it
736,43.86,48.1,Reasoning like that could mean your life
737,48.64,54.699999999999996,A look conveying hope to the merciless cloudless sky
738,54.300000000000004,60.21,My leaves are brown and my rootstock is bone dry
739,60.27,63.63,But I can hear a sound in the distance
740,63.63,66.2,And now I feel that I've got no resistance
741,66.2,70.27,It's gonna come and it's gonna run me down
742,69.93,72.79,Like a bulldozer
743,75.81,79.76,Bulldozer
744,81.24,87.37,It's gonna run me down
745,87.37,92.7,It's gonna run me down
746,92.81,97.67,My fight is all gone and I got nothing left to give
747,98.73,103.3,This is surely not the way we were meant to live
748,104.56,107.69,Wearing down our human resources
749,107.69,110.46,We got no time to be scared or be cautious
750,110.46,114.19,Who keep the desert from the door
751,115.1,119.76,They're moving in closer with the ugly ravenous machines
752,120.79,126.33,Laying down roads where the grass used to be so green
753,126.59,129.74,Who is gonna stop the erosion
754,129.74,132.49,There's just no way to contain this explosion
755,132.49,136.53,It's gonna come and it's gonna run me down
756,136.29999999999998,138.96,Like a bulldozer
757,142.04,145.96,Bulldozer
758,147.13,153.57,It's gonna run me down
759,153.57,159.04,It's gonna run me down
760,165.01,170.2,Your words will spinning like a kite caught in a gale
761,170.2,176.2,Knives would cut the cloth to take the wind out of my sails
762,176.2,179.37,Your words could break a bone
763,179.37,182.2,Your words flow like a stone
764,182.2,186.74,Your words could run right over me
765,186.74,188.21,Like a
766,242.07,246.93,Reeling in the early evening haze
767,247.79,252.87,Safe from the sun's derisive gaze
768,253.41,256.71,Loose tongues are always a killer
769,256.71,259.2,Imagination's a surrogate filler
770,259.2,263.7,Who'll fix the damage once it's done?
771,264.01,269.07,Stamping down tough on a ground that's drying hard
772,269.76,274.33,You're pushing for a mile when you know I only gave a yard
773,275.33,278.66,It's gonna take some time to repair it until then we just
774,278.66,281.51,Until then we'll just have to wear it
775,281.51,285.27,Never gonna let it run me down
776,285.13,288.27,Like a bulldozer
777,290.76,294.87,Bulldozer
778,296.41,302.66,Never let it run me down
779,302.66,308.1,Never let it run me down
780,318.36,320.84,Never let it
781,321.33,324.60999999999996,Run me down
782,324.53000000000003,326.24,Never let it
783,326.07,330.04,Run me down
