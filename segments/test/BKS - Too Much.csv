491,43.5,47.41,You made your bed now you lie in it
492,47.16,50.9,And don't you ever forget
493,50.61,55.11,That I can settle this with a blind one
494,55.11,59.1,And you know you'll hang on to a touch
495,58.9,64.0,You never break free cause you know deep inside
496,64.0,66.7,"Girl, you love me too much"
497,68.02,72.29,She met him last year at the local
498,72.00999999999999,76.10000000000001,Lookin' so lonely and lost
499,75.8,80.01,And looking like life had sure changed him

505,98.80999999999999,102.79,Now it didn't take a long till he hit her  she
506,102.79,106.55000000000001,While he was leaning on his liquid crutch
507,106.52,111.06,She said I got to forgive you and it's probably my fault
508,111.06,114.56,"And boy, I love you too much"
509,152.72,156.84,She's going away down the road now
510,156.84,160.7,Into the great beyond
511,160.66,164.92,Who knows what she will find there
512,164.92,167.96,Who knows where she belongs
513,168.01999999999998,172.2,She said she's gonna kick over the traces
514,172.2,175.96,And this time she's gonna be strong
515,175.96,179.94,But she's looking in all the wrong faces
516,180.0,183.55,And she is just too far gone
517,183.16,187.56,Well it never takes long till they leave her
518,187.56,191.2,Stinging from the loneliest touch
519,191.2,195.51,Will she ever break free or just surrender again
520,195.51,199.52,You know it happens too much
