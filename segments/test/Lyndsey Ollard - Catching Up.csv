25,13.82,19.46,Why oh why won't someone tell me
26,20.13,25.5,God only knows what I should do
27,26.28,32.18,Now watch the world is moving forward
28,32.64,37.78,"But I am stuck, I can't push through"
29,39.13,44.03,I'm just catching up with yesterday
30,45.31,51.56,By tomorrow I'll be ready for today
31,51.34,57.5,And I'm just catching up with yesterday
32,57.73,64.57000000000001,"And I don't know what to do, no"
33,64.28999999999999,70.24,"A fragile girl, a broken woman"
34,70.39,75.87,These walls have closed in all around
35,76.52,83.03,And I'm trapped inside this hazy prism
36,82.83,88.49,And my heart is nowhere to be found
37,89.15,95.01,The clouds above about to thunder
38,95.39,101.05,In this stormy atmosphere
39,101.68,108.53,But by now I thought I'd be there
40,108.53,113.28,But the destination's what I fear
41,114.65,120.65,I'm just catching up with yesterday
42,120.77,127.54,By tomorrow I'll be ready for today
43,127.32,133.9,So I'm just catching up with yesterday
44,133.5,140.0,"And I don't know what to do, no"
45,140.0,146.06,Oh I can't shake this feeling
46,146.1,151.37,It steals contentment in my mind
47,152.08,157.27,And I keep looking for the answers
48,157.27,164.17,"Oh that I, that I just can't seem to find"
49,164.79,171.59,And I'm just catching up with yesterday
50,171.37,177.79,But by tomorrow I'll be ready for today
51,177.5,184.32,Said I'm just catching up with yesterday
52,184.4,190.9,"And I don't know what to do, no"
